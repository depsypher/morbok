'deps' are defined as those things which are required to compile or develop lombok, but which aren't required when
actually running lombok. The main lombok code is dependent on all libraries in the 'lombok' directory, whilst the agents
are dependent on both the contents of the 'agent' directory and the agent's specific directory (e.g. 'eclipse.agent').

For dependencies which need to be available at runtime, see the 'lib' directory.
